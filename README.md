# WINIT

Description:
	WINIT is an android application which aims to capture the ingredients parts of the products so that people can be aware of what their meanings are and to see if there are any cancerous, allergy trigger etc. ingredient in the product.
  
  This is the end project of the CS102 course of Bilkent University. By making this project, the theories learnt in the course were applied to a real life project.
  
  This project was made by a group of five students. I was mainly responsible of implementing OCR to the project.
